# Snake-Game
#This is a Python implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding walls and the snake's own body. The player can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The game keeps track of the player's score and ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body. The game's graphics are drawn using the Turtle library, and the game loop is implemented using a while loop. This code can be used as a starting point for building more complex games using Python and the Turtle library.
